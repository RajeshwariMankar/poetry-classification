I come from haunts of coot and hern;
 I make a sudden sally 
And sparkle out among the fern, 
To bicker down a valley.

By thirty hills I hurry down,
 Or slip between the ridges,
 By twenty thorpes, a little town,
 And half a hundred bridges.

 Till last by Philip's farm I flow
 To join the brimming river,
 For men may come and men may go,
 But I go on for ever.
